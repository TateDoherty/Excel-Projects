# PresidentCleaningProject
Using a data set from kaggle, I hope to prove my abilities to clean data in excel using data on Presidents of the United States.

 In order to make the President data set clean I...

- removed duplicates by using the "Remove Duplicates" button in the "Data" Tab
- made all president names ProperCase (John Admas) with =PROPER function
- cleaned "party" column data using filter tool and copy and paste (Republicans --> Republican)
- removed white spaces from "vice" column using =TRIM function
- changed salary in "salary" column from currency to a number to make the salary data more useful on other systems
- fixed "date updated" and "date created colums" by making the dates in short date format in the Home Tab 
- made new columns for each column that needed to be copy and pasted as a value so I could delete the original unclean column using cntrl + shift + v
- deleted unusable data columns such as the "prior" column
